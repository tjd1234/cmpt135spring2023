## Definition
A base-2 number consisting of 0s and 1s. 0 and 1 are called **bits**, and a sequence of 1 or more bits is called a **bit string**, or a binary number when the bit string is representing a number.

The place values of a base 2 number represent powers of 2, in contrast to regular decimal numbers where the place values represent powers of 10.

## Example
The base 2 binary number 10011 is equal to 19 in base 10. In particular, $19 = 1\cdot 2^{16} + 1\cdot 2^{2} + 1\cdot 2^{1}$, i.e. the 1-bits in the 10011 indicate which powers of 2 should be summed to get the number.
