# System Testing
#terminology 

## Definition
Testing an entire program. Can only be done when you have a complete, or nearly complete, program. Compare this to [[unit testing]], where individual functions are tested.

## Example
Suppose you've written an email program that sends and receives email. A system test might involve actually using the program the way ordinary users would. So a non-technical user could be involved in the testing.
