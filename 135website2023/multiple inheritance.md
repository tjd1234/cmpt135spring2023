## Definition
When a class inherits from two, or more, methods. C++ supports multiple inheritance, but many other languages do not since it is introduces extra complexities.

In contrast, [[single inheritance]] is when a class inherits from exactly one other class.

We will not use multiple inheritance in this course.
