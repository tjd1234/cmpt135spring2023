## Definition
A general problem-solving strategy that says to solve a big problem you should divide it into smaller problems, solve those smaller problems, and then combine those solutions to solve the original problem.

## Example
[[Mergesort]] is an example of a divide and conquer [[algorithm]]. To sort a list of numbers, [[mergesort]] divides the list into two parts, the left half and the right half. It then (recursively) sorts the left, (recursively) sorts the right half, and then merges the sorted lists together so that the entire list is sorted.
