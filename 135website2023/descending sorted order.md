#terminology

## Definition
A sequence of numbers or strings (or any value that can be ordered) arranged in a linear sequence from largest to smallest.

This is synonymous with [[reverse sorted order]]. If the items are strings, then this is the same as reverse alphabetical order. 

## Example
These sequences are all in descending sorted order:
- [], i.e. the empty sequence
- [5]
- [6,5]
- [200,8,6,5]
- [200,8,6,6,6,5]
- [3,3,3,3]

Here are some sequences that are *not* in descending sorted order:
- [2,3,5] is *not* in descending sorted order
- [1,2,3,4,3,2,1] is *not* in descending sorted order
- [4,3,2,1,5] is *not* in descending sorted order
