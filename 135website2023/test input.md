#terminology 

## Definition
The input to a unit test. This is often created by the programmer, e.g. they choose an input that they know is important, or tricky, or representative of a typical input. It's also common to randomly generate test inputs (as long as you have some way to generate the corresponding expected output)

## Example
Suppose `int add(int x, int y)` is a function to be tested. Then one test input for it would be `(3, 4)`.
