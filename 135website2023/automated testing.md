#terminology 

## Definition
Running [[test]]s automatically using a program, without the need for a human to either do the test or to (immediately) check the results. Whenever possible testing should be automated, as [[manual testing]] is tedious and error-prone.

## Example
See [[testing code]] for a number of ways to automate testing.
