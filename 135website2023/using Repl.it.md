You can run C++ in the browser using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~).

By default, [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) uses the Clang compiler instead of g++. But if you upload the course makefile and type `make main` (or whatever the name of your `.cpp` file is), it appears to let you compile and run your program using g++. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/~) gives you a complete shell online.
