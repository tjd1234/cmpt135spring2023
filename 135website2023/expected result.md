## Definition
In a [[test]], the expected result is the value that the function being tested is expected to return when given the [[test input]]. Expected results are often generated by the programmer by hand. If there happens to be a function that can generate the correct answer, the that could be used to generate the expected result. In practice, this can occur when you are, say, writing a more efficient version of a function: you can test the correctness of the new fast function by comparing its output to the old slow function.

## Example
Suppose `int add(int x, int y)` is a function to be tested. If for the [[test input]] `(3, 4)` the expected result is `7`.
