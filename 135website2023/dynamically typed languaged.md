#terminology 

## Definition
A dynamically typed programming language is a language where the types of many expressions are known only at *run* time.

## Example
Python is a dynamically typed language since the values of many expressions are not known until the program runs. 

In contrast, C++ is a [[statically typed language]] language because the type of most C++ expressions is known at compile-time.
