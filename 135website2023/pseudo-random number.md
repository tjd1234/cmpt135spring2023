## Definition
A "random" number generated by a computer. The term "pseudo" is used to indicate that the number might not be truly random, but may have some bias due to the hardware of the computer or the algorithm used to generate the number.

Random numbers on a computer are typically generated using an arithmetic algorithm plus a *seed* number that determines the sequence of numbers.

For most purposes, pseudo-random numbers with a more or less random seed (e.g. based on time --- see the example below) are adequate for most programs. But in some cases, such as security, much more careful methods for generating random numbers are used to make sure that malicious hackers can't predict the random numbers for some nefarious purpose.

## Example
In C++, the `rand()` function from `<cmath` returns a random `int` in the range 0 to `RAND_MAX` (some very large i`int`). 

`rand()` returns the same sequence of numbers every time it is called if the *seed* is the same. The `srand(x)` function used to set the seed value. If the seed `x` is set to be, say, the current time on the computers clock, then the sequence of random numbers is unpredictable (or at least much hard to predict):

```cpp
srand(time(NULL));  // srand sets the seed for rand()
                    // time comes from <ctime>
```
