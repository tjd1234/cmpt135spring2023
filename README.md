# Welcome to CMPT 135!

This site has some code that appears in lectures and is referenced from [the
course notes](https://publish.obsidian.md/cmpt135) or [Canvas](sfu.canvas.ca).
For course notes are in [this Obsidian
website](https://publish.obsidian.md/cmpt135). Announcements, marks, assignment
submission, discussion, etc. are in [Canvas](sfu.canvas.ca), and the weekly
lecture notes are [the course notes](https://publish.obsidian.md/cmpt135).

## Standard Course Files

These are standard files used in most lectures and assignments. You should
download them to your computer.

- [standard course makefile](starter_files/makefile). Unless told otherwise, use
  it when compiling all your code for this course.
- [hello_world.cpp](starter_files/hello_world.cpp). This is an example program
  that prints "Hello, world!" to the screen. In the comments there are
  instructions for using the [standard course makefile](starter_files/makefile).
- [cmpt_error.h](starter_files/cmpt_error.h). This contains a simple `error`
  function that will stop your program and print an error message. It might be
  used in some assignments.
- [cmpt_trace.h](starter_files/cmpt_trace.h) and
  [cmpt_trace.cpp](cmpt_trace.cpp) print consistently indented message when a
  function is entered and when it is exited. This can be useful for debugging,
  and can result in nice patterns when used with recursive functions.
